# Interview Answers
Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics. These will not be counted as a part of your sprint score but will be helpful for preparing you for your endorsement interview, and enhancing overall understanding.

1. What are the main differences between a stateful and a functional component?

     The difference is that one has state, and the other doesn't. That means the stateful components are keeping track of changing data, while functional components print out what is given to them via props, or they always render the same thing.

2. When does a componentWillMount function be called? What about a componentWillUpdate?

    ComponentWillMount is called in the first state after all the components have rendered.  It gets called from the child component upward to the parent in a bubbling fashion.  

    ComponentWillUpdate gets called in the second phase of the lifecycle, when state changes, causes a rerender of the component.

3. Define stateful logic.

    Stateful logic is any logic that depends directly on state, uses state directly, or is affected by state.

4. What are the three step of creating a successful test? What is done in each phase?

   The three steps are Arrange, Action, and Assert.  Arrange prepares the testing environmoent, renders the component or App and calls the elements to be tested.  Action simulates a user action.  And Assert makes statements about what behavior we expect to happen or what we as the user expect to see.
